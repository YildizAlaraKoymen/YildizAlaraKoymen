Hello! I'm Alara, a fourth-year student at Middle East Technical University (Northern Cyprus Campus), currently diving deep into the world of web development. I'm a curious learner, always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set.

Right now, I'm focused on becoming fluent in React and CSS, building dynamic, user-friendly interfaces as I go. Outside of tech, I find joy in painting, which keeps my creativity flowing and helps me bring a unique perspective to my development work.
